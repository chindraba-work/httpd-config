### Virtual server configuration ############################################
#
# VirtualHost: If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.
#

# Determine which versions of the virtual host configurations
# to load based on requirements for and presense of SSL

# For non-SSL servers, load the non-SSL configs only
<IfDefine !SSL_ONLY>
    IncludeOptional sites_enabled/*.vhost.conf
</IfDefine>

# For SSL enabled servers where SSL is not restricted, load the
# SSL configs.
<IfDefine SSL>
    <IfDefine !NOSSL>
        IncludeOptional sites_enabled/*.vhost.ssl.conf
    </IfDefine>
</IfDefine>
